        A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory
        in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with saint-like icons worthy
        of their own hagiographies, he with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.He soon
        joined the senior Men in Blue in Sri Lanka, come August 2008. In the absence of the regular openers, he was
        given a chance to open the batting in the ODI series. He played some commendable knocks in his extended run as
        an opener, as India went on to win the ODI series. However, the established and formidable pair of Tendulkar and
        Sehwag kept him out of the team. The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly
        demonstrating that he belonged at a much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. He then
        traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging players tournament and stamped his authority all over the bowling
        attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé too, placing a fluent hundred in the final against South
        Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. The young prodigy, barely old enough to receive his
        man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries and two
        fifties, ensuring
        that he remained fresh in the selectors' minds.The selectors had no choice but to give he another go in the
        Indian side, and this time he strung together a number of impressive scores. After being given an extended run,
        he repaid their faith by notching up his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka in
        December 2009 - his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases. In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest
        stage of them all, he, along with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue
        effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early. This knock played a crucial role in setting the
        platform for MS Dhoni's fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on
        that enchanting evening in Mumbai.
